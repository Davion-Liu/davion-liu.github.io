I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student at [Institute of Computing Technology](http://www.ict.ac.cn/), [Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://www.cas.cn/). I am a member of [CAS Key Lab of Web Data Science and Technology](http://www.bigdatalab.ac.cn/). My research interests lie in the robustness of Information Retrieval (IR), with a special focus on adversarial and out-of-distribution perspectives.

Contact me via email if you have any interest in discussing/working/cooperating with me.
